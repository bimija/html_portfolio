<h1>The Best Shows according to ShoeShineBoy</h1>
<h2>My top three shows of all  time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>the original Star Trek series</h3>
    <p>This was the major series that sparked a whole new generation <br/>
    on how to think about the future.</p>
<h3>Remake of Battle Star Galactica</h3>
    <p>Each eppisode dealt with a subject on how the human race would have to <br/>
    deal with a desimated human race and how it would survive</p>
<h3>The 100</h3>
        <p>I never read the book series but have been told the tv series was much better.<br/>
        Seven seasons with an ending befitting the epic series.  King of a future remake of<br/> 
        Lord of the Flies.</p>
<h4>As you can probably tell I really enjoy SciFi.</h4>
