<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am a 67 year old retired international pilot with 45 yeare aviation experience both commercial and military.
  To answer the first question that comes to most peoples minds is "yes, I have seen an unidentified flying object. Only once late in my career and did report it  to 
  the FAA controlers." Now on the the present, in retirement I am looking for a second life, I have always loved the art of programming. I have some self 
  learned skills in python, assembly, and linux. Web design is new to me but I am really interested. I am hoping that I can carve out a small business
  with these skills.
